# bin/setup is the canonical Rails entry point. It handles bundle install,

# exec'ing bin/dev inside postCreate (we want the container to come up
# cleanly; the dev runs the server when ready).

echo "=== Installing Playwright browser (chromium) ==="
# Runs AFTER bin/setup's `npm ci`, so the pinned @playwright/test (and its
# `playwright` CLI) is already in node_modules. --no-install forces npx to use
# that local binary: it never fetches a package, so it can't hang on an
# interactive "Ok to proceed?" prompt in a non-interactive postCreate, and it
# installs the browser revision matching the pinned Playwright. `playwright
# install` is itself idempotent (skips already-downloaded browsers).

=== Dev environment ready (GitHub Codespaces) ===

Next steps:
  1. Run: bin/dev
  2. Open the app: click the port 3000 entry in the PORTS panel (or the
     auto-forward notification) — not http://localhost:3000.
  3. Sign in (passwordless): request a magic link, then open it from
     Letter Opener Web on the forwarded port 1080 URL (also in the PORTS panel).

.env was created from .env.example; edit it if you need to change any defaults.

=== Dev environment ready ===

Next steps:
  1. Edit .env (copied from .env.example) if you need to change any defaults
  2. Run: bin/dev
  3. Visit: http://localhost:3000

For deployment with Kamal:
  1. Edit config/deploy.yml (server IP, registry, app name)
  2. Set KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD in .kamal/secrets
  3. Run: bin/kamal setup
