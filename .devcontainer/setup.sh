=== Dev environment ready (GitHub Codespaces) ===

Next steps:
  1. Run: bin/dev
  2. Open the app: click the port 3000 entry in the PORTS panel (or the
     auto-forward notification) — not http://localhost:3000.
  3. Sign in (passwordless): request a magic link, then open it from
     Letter Opener Web on the forwarded port 1080 URL (also in the PORTS panel).

.env was created from .env.example; edit it if you need to change any defaults.

  2. Run: bin/dev
  3. Visit: http://localhost:3000

For deployment with Kamal:
  1. Edit config/deploy.yml (server IP, registry, app name)
  2. Set KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD in .kamal/secrets
  3. Run: bin/kamal setup
