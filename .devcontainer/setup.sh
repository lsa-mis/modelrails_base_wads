=== Dev environment ready (GitHub Codespaces) ===

Next steps:
  1. Run: bin/dev
  2. Open the app: click the port 3000 entry in the PORTS panel (or the
     auto-forward notification) — not http://localhost:3000.
  3. Sign in (passwordless): request a magic link, then read it in the dev
     mail inbox — append /letter_opener to your forwarded port 3000 URL
     (dev never sends real email).

.env was created from .env.example; edit it if you need to change any defaults.

=== Dev environment ready ===

Next steps:
  1. Edit .env (copied from .env.example) if you need to change any defaults
  2. Run: bin/dev
  3. Visit: http://localhost:3000

For deployment with Kamal:
  1. Edit config/deploy.yml (server IP, registry, app name)
  2. Set KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD in .kamal/secrets
  3. Run: bin/kamal setup
