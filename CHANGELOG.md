# Changelog

All notable changes to ModelRails are documented here, organized by phase.

## [Unreleased]

## v2.0.0 — Passwordless Auth, Workspace Lifecycle & Navigation IA (2026-07-06)

### Breaking

- Git history rewritten to purge the internal root `docs/` directory (now the separate [modelrails_base_docs](https://github.com/dschmura/modelrails_base_docs) repo) — every commit SHA changed; existing clones and forks must re-sync (`git fetch && git reset --hard origin/main`).
- `config/deploy.yml` `servers.web` moved from a flat host list to a `hosts:` + `options:` structure for `max-replicas: 1`; forks that customized it must migrate — see `app/docs/deployment.md` (#135).
- Email verification switched to signed, stateless tokens; dropped the `verification_token`/`verification_sent_at` columns — links issued before upgrade stop working (#178).

### Added

- Workspaces index client-side filter + denser cards — the filter appears once the "Other workspaces" list is long enough to scan; each card sets the logo beside the name with a single metadata line (#428).
- Persistent workspace-identity bar anchoring the workspace shell, with tightened content spacing (#423).
- Workspace & project lifecycle — Archive (reversible; restore from the Archived section) and permanent Delete (workspace deletion gated by a type-the-name confirmation), cascading workspace → projects (#413, #414).
- Operator workspace lock — `rails "workspaces:suspend[slug]"` / `"workspaces:unsuspend[slug]"` puts a workspace on hold ("This workspace is locked."), blocking owners until released (#415).
- Passwordless-first sign-in — magic link is the default; a password is an opt-in set from Security settings (#374).
- Passkeys / WebAuthn — register platform authenticators and sign in with a discoverable credential (#375, #376).
- Browser-hosted GitHub Codespace — one-click cloud dev environment; boots, signs in, and runs the suite in-container (#385).
- Customizable Select picker — native `<select>` styled via `appearance: base-select` where supported, with an untouched native fallback elsewhere (#399, #402).
- `/docs` split into user and developer audience modes with an always-visible audience switcher (#381, #382).
- Per-project tools — extensible registry, per-project toggle, project-home tabs, and a self-hiding onboarding step (#364).
- First-run onboarding journey (`:none`) — name workspace → first project → invite, with a soft email-verification gate (#362, #363).
- `ClientAccess` model — scopes an external client to one project without a workspace membership or seat (#365).
- Per-project Clientside toggle, per-resource "share with client side" flag, and a read-only `Clientside::` area (#366).
- Client invite flow — `Invitation` client variant, `InvitationMailer#invite_client`, and client-only home routing (#367).
- `:none` onboarding posture (`WORKSPACE_ON_SIGNUP=none`) — signup creates no workspace; forks override `authenticated_home_path` (#343).
- Fork-owned brand-color seam `_brand.css` (`merge=ours`) — swap the primary palette without merge conflicts (#313).
- Deployment docs — Thruster X-Sendfile offload with a "don't set `x_sendfile_header`" guard, plus a health-check-timeout entry.
- `bin/deploy-guide` — target-aware deployment guidance (kamal / self-host / managed) plus a "without Kamal" contract section.
- Lookbook component explorer at `/lookbook` (development-only) for the vendored `UI::*` components.
- Vendored `UI::*` ViewComponents via the dev-only `modelrails_ui` gem; the form builder, `_modal`, and `avatar_for` delegate with no output change.
- Appearance destination time-zone picker — explicit `override=true` preserves the choice against the browser beacon (#154).
- Settings hub destinations — disambiguated H1s/descriptions, a shared page-header partial, and an Appearance page (#150).
- Settings hub mobile drawer — off-canvas sidebar below 768px with focus trap + ESC/click-outside dismiss (#148).
- Settings hub shell — sidebar-equipped `settings.html.erb` with context-adaptive, Pundit-gated items and Turbo morph.
- Personal-workspace OKLCH context ramp — desaturated slate via `[data-workspace-kind="personal"]`.
- Chroma-boosted workspace color swatch in the sidebar switcher.
- Notifications v1 — in-app bell + triage page, real-time broadcasts, preferences UI, email digests, and 10 notifier types (#48, #53–#56, #64–#71).
- Optional VS Code Dev Container matching the production image (#129).
- `.env.example` documenting required environment variables (#129).
- YJIT enabled in production (#129).
- CI builds the production Docker image on every PR (#134).
- Deployment, background-jobs, and dev-environment docs at `/docs` (#136).
- Clear "invitation was for a different email" notice on verification, signup, and accept (#177, #180).
- Single-tenant preset (`WORKSPACE_ON_SIGNUP=shared`) — one shared workspace, tenancy UI suppressed, env-driven seed.
- Per-workspace `join_policy` (`invite`/`open_link`) with a revocable `WorkspaceJoinLink`; both join flows wired; instance ceiling via `SIGNUP_PERMITTED_JOIN_STRATEGIES`.
- Fork seams — brand strings, `draw(:app)` product routes, extendable `/docs` categories, and `merge=ours` fork-owned paths.
- In-app forking guide at `/docs/forking`.

### Changed

- Workspace navigation IA — settings becomes a section of the workspace shell (Profile / Members / Limits under an active "Settings"), not a separate layout; drops the `settings_context` macro (#425).
- Mobile menu restructured — account actions first, workspaces below (recency-ordered, capped, with an "All workspaces" overflow) (#426).
- Mobile section-nav strip — in-page secondary nav replacing the header-accordion sub-nav hoist (#422).
- Email-first sign-in — one email field routes to password, magic link, or passkey; the connected-accounts page reflects real linked state (#377).
- Retired the deferred "personal workspace"/"personal profile" copy → "your workspace"/"your profile"; section label "Account" → "You" (honest-naming).
- Removed the half-wired dynamic-PWA scaffold; the static `public/manifest.webmanifest` stays (#306).
- Fork-readiness code-quality cleanup — duck-typed project resolution, narrower rescues, named activity-log records (#305).
- `.env.example` documents every operator-settable ENV var, with a template invariant guarding against drift (#298).
- SQLite `journal_mode: wal` declared explicitly in `config/database.yml`, with the busy-handler behavior pinned by spec (#304).
- CI lint tooling version-pinned — markdownlint + herb-lint in `package.json` via `npx`; dropped brakeman `--ensure-latest` (#299).
- Unified the UI signal vocabulary to `info·success·warning·danger`; signal chips move to tinted surfaces, fixing the muddy warning badge.
- Avatar notification indicator restored as a severity dot (v2) — desktop on the avatar, mobile on the hamburger; standalone bell removed.
- Email/password signup defers invitation acceptance until the email is verified (#175).
- `TENANCY_ONBOARDING` renamed to `WORKSPACE_ON_SIGNUP` — reads honestly (the app is always multi-tenant).
- Sidebar skips the personal-only `memberships` eager-load unless onboarding is `:personal` (#344).
- Workspaces index rewritten from phonebook to workbench — pinned-current row, last-accessed sort, inline Switch/Leave; adds `memberships.last_accessed_at`.
- Mobile shell — the header expands accordion-style inline, replacing the off-canvas drawer (#148).
- Header workspace switcher hides personal workspaces; the Settings sidebar switcher is the explicit switch surface (#145).
- Account, Notification, Security, and Workspace settings destinations use the shared settings page header.
- Motion-safe sidebar transitions; `data-settings-context-kind` → `data-workspace-kind`; hover prefetch on settings/switcher links.
- Route consolidation — `workspaces#edit` serves Profile, `workspaces/settings#edit` narrows to Limits & Plan (Admin-visible via `ProfilePolicy`).
- Notifications bell is a standalone header affordance; the user menu collapses to an identity block + sign-out.
- Mobile-accordion sidebar contents flow inline via chrome-free `_*_sidebar_items` partials.
- Sidebar items gain a divider and a context-aware section label (`Account`/`Workspace`).
- Sidebar nav items gain Heroicons v1 outline icons (8 new SVGs, auto-discovered).

### Removed

- `/me` ("Your home") — the workspace home consolidates to `/workspaces`, which gains an identity anchor (#429).
- Deprecated `invitations#index` redirect route + the redundant "Invitations" sidebar item — folded into the members surface (#398).
- `settings-drawer` Stimulus controller, `*.mobile_drawer.*` locales, and the off-canvas markup — superseded by the header accordion.
- `Workspaces::BrandingsController` + `/workspaces/:slug/branding/*` routes — identity picker moved to `WorkspacesController#identity_picker_hub`.
- `Workspaces::BrandingPolicy` — replaced by `Workspaces::ProfilePolicy`.
- Orphan header dropdown partials + the `navigation.new_workspace` locale — completes Path Y (the sidebar switcher is canonical).
- Header "Workspaces" text link + the `navigation.workspaces` locale — the sidebar switcher is the sole workspace affordance.

### Fixed

- Dev mail-preview location — `/letter_opener` (a Rails engine on the app), not the dead port 1080; corrected across the devcontainer, setup message, `/docs`, and the invariant spec (#431).
- `base-select` chevron layout + de-duplicated select labels (#421).
- Signups-closed sign-in view renders inside the turbo-frame instead of vanishing (#384).
- Codespaces boot — trixie `moby:false`, `bin/setup` (libssl-dev + Node), non-interactive Playwright, Solid Queue self-heal, and forwarded-proxy CSRF Origin (#386, #387, #388, #396, #397).
- Settings-hub Turbo morph is now actually active — `_layout_head` yields `:head` so the morph meta emits (#327).
- Single-tenant preset — invitation-driven signups adopt the invitation's role instead of a placeholder Member.
- Unauthenticated invitees can accept under invite-only signup — the accept page stashes the pending token (#345).
- Development mailer URLs follow the running `PORT` so letter_opener links work on non-default ports (#346).
- `Broadcastable` respects subclass `broadcast_events` overrides (destroys broadcast on `ProjectMembership`).
- Fixed the production `docker build` failure after the Ruby pin change (#132).

### Accessibility

- Alert severity icons (modelrails_ui v0.5.0) — a colour-blind-safe non-colour cue on info/success/warning/danger alerts; normalized warning triangle (#427).
- Quiet-hours warning sits in a stable `role="status"` wrapper so screen readers reliably announce it (#302).
- `autocomplete="off"` on the read-only join-link copy field, clearing the herb-lint warning (#299).
- WCAG 2.2 AAA contrast pass — six tokens bumped to 7:1; `text-muted` matches `text-body` (hierarchy via size/weight).
- axe-core CI promoted `wcag2aa` → `wcag2aaa`, with contrast-ratio/hex/font diagnostics in failures.
- Code blocks at `/docs` meet WCAG 2.2 AAA contrast in both themes (#137).

### Security

- New-member admission blocked into archived, deleted, or locked workspaces on every path — join links, invitations, signup claims, and the client area — with generic copy that never reveals which lifecycle state blocked an outsider (#417).
- Home workspaces (personal, and the shared instance workspace) can no longer be archived or deleted — a policy exemption plus a model guard that also covers console and direct-call paths (#417).
- Dependency CVE bumps — nokogiri/faraday (#371), css_parser 3.0.0/msgpack 1.8.3 (#400); unfixable thruster Go CVEs ignored in the image scan (#380, #395).
- Invitation acceptance bound to the invited email across every path and deferred until verified — a leaked link can't be redeemed by someone else (#175, #176).
- Per-recipient email throttle across senders — prevents N attackers from collectively flooding one inbox.
- Cross-user OAuth collision alert — a defense-in-depth email when someone tries to link your identity to another account.

### Maintenance

- `bundler-audit` runs in Lefthook pre-push, mirroring CI `scan_ruby` (#372).
- Bullet safelists consolidated into one shared source (`lib/bullet_safelists.rb`) so development and test can't drift (#403).
- `modelrails_ui` bumped to v0.4.0 (customizable-select); component previews de-flaked by dropping external CDN assets (#401, #373).
- Ruby bumped to 4.0.4 and enforced by Bundler across dev, CI, and production (#129).
- Production image no longer ships test gems (#129).
- Production deploys constrained to one web container with a longer job-drain window (#135, #130).
- Solid Queue uses named queues (`default`/`mailers`/`low`) (#135).
- Faster CI on native architectures via parallel bootsnap precompile (#131).
- IDN punycode normalization in `EmailNormalizer` for canonical email comparison.

## v1.4.0 — OAuth Hardening & Design System Primitives v2 (2026-04-28)

### Security

- Email normalization for storage and equality comparison now uses Unicode NFC + downcase + strip via a new `EmailNormalizer` module (`app/lib/email_normalizer.rb`). The `User` model's `normalizes :email_address` and `:pending_email` declarations route through it, so all `find_by` lookups and writes get canonical form (Rails 7.1 auto-applies normalizers to lookup values). The OAuth callback's "OAuth email matches user's primary email" check uses `EmailNormalizer.equivalent?` so an email like `café@example.com` matches itself across NFC vs NFD encodings — previously these would compare as different bytes despite being visually identical, forcing international users through email verification on every OAuth sign-in. Gravatar SHA-256 hashing also uses canonical form so the same email always produces the same Gravatar URL regardless of input encoding. IDN punycode conversion (e.g., `bücher.de` ↔ `xn--bcher-kva.de`) is NOT handled — explicitly deferred until a real interop concern surfaces; would require an addressable-style gem.
- `Authentication#generate_verification_token!` now retries up to 3 times on `ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique` (defensive against the astronomically-unlikely 256-bit token collision). The `Account::ConnectedAccountsController#resend_verification` action also rescues `RecordNotUnique` at the request level — if every regenerated token still collides, users see a graceful "try again" alert instead of a 500 error.
- OAuth callbacks now check `auth_hash.info.email_verified` before auto-verifying or auto-linking. When an OAuth provider explicitly reports the email as unverified (Google's `info.email_verified: false` for unverified Google accounts), `OmniauthCallbacksController` no longer (a) auto-verifies a newly-linked authentication for a signed-in user even when the OAuth email matches the user's primary email, (b) auto-links a brand-new OAuth signup to an existing verified user account by email match, or (c) auto-verifies and signs in a fresh user from OAuth — instead, the new user is created with a pending authentication and a verification email is sent without signing them in. Closes the account-takeover surface where an attacker could create an unverified Google account using a victim's email and have the app auto-link the OAuth identity to the victim. Providers that don't expose `info.email_verified` (e.g., GitHub) are treated as implicitly verified — only an explicit `false` triggers the gate, preserving existing GitHub OAuth behavior.

### Added

- Design system primitives v2: semantic spacing tokens (`--space-section-gap`, `--space-row-padding`, `--space-action-group-gap`, `--form-input-height`) defined in `app/assets/tailwind/tokens/_spacing.css`. Tokens are CSS-var-only — never registered in `@theme` so they don't leak as Tailwind utility classes. Consumed inside `@layer components` rules and `TailwindFormBuilder` constants.
- Component utilities under a new `@layer components` block in `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`: `.btn-touch-target` (44×44 minimum, reads `--form-input-height`), `.btn-text` (font-weight/underline/focus-visible base), `.btn-text-danger` and `.btn-text-interactive` (color variants), `.action-group` (inline-flex with `--space-action-group-gap`).
- Layout utility `.page-container` (`max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4`) for narrow page wrappers — settings, account, and form-centric flows.
- `design-system.md` (now in [modelrails_base_docs](https://github.com/dschmura/modelrails_base_docs)) — single-source reference for the spacing convention, semantic tokens, component utilities, class ordering convention, and migration recipe. Linked from README.md.

### Changed

- `app/views/sessions/email_error.html.erb` now uses `TailwindFormBuilder` via a new `EmailLookupForm` ActiveModel form object (`app/models/email_lookup_form.rb`). The view no longer hand-rolls form-input classes; the form builder auto-applies error styling, ARIA attributes (`aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`, `role="alert"`), and inline error messages from the model's `errors` API. Validation is unified: blank email, missing email, and malformed email all surface the same `sessions.lookup.invalid_email` notice ("Please enter a valid email address."). Closes the v1.3.0 design-system debt note about this view bypassing the form builder.
- Refactored `app/views/account/connected_accounts/index.html.erb` to consume the new utilities (proof refactor — same visual output as before). Subtle visual change: the Resend button now inherits `font-medium` from `.btn-text`, matching Cancel and Disconnect. This unifies a pre-existing inconsistency where Resend was visually slightly lighter than the other text buttons.
- `TailwindFormBuilder` (`app/form_builders/tailwind_form_builder.rb`) now reads `--form-input-height` via `min-h-[var(--form-input-height)]` in three constants (`FIELD_BASE`, `SUBMIT_CLASSES`, `FILE_FIELD_CLASSES`) instead of hardcoded `min-h-[44px]`. Single source of truth for touch-target height across all form inputs, submit buttons, and file fields. Same 44px value, named source.
- `.btn-text` uses `focus-visible:` (not `focus:`) for the focus ring, matching the project's existing `.biscuit-btn` pattern. Focus rings now appear for keyboard navigation but not for mouse clicks.

### Fixed

- ERB lint job (`herb-lint`) now passes on `_a11y_sim.html.erb` after refactoring the dev-only mode-icons hash from `<% end,` syntax (rejected by herb-lint 0.9+'s `parser-no-errors` rule) to separate `capture do %>...<% end %>` assignments. Same compiled output, parser-friendly structure.
- CI test job now installs `libvips42t64` on the Ubuntu runner so Active Storage image variants generate without `LoadError`. Affected 9 identity-picker system specs that all failed with the same shared-library load error; root cause was missing system dependency, not test logic.
- Replaced the flaky `expect(page).not_to have_css("script")` assertion in the registration XSS-prevention spec with a deterministic raw-HTML byte check (`page.html.include?("<script>alert('xss')</script>")` plus a positive control on the escaped form). The original assertion depended on Capybara's visibility filter excluding hidden layout `<script>` tags, which Playwright sometimes computed inconsistently during page transitions.

## v1.3.0 — Verified OAuth Account Linking

### User-facing

- **Email verification for OAuth links with mismatched email.** When a signed-in user links a new OAuth provider whose email differs from their primary email, the linked authentication is created in pending state and a confirmation email is sent to the OAuth-returned address. The user must click the verification link before that sign-in method is active. Auto-verifies when the OAuth email matches the primary email (case-insensitive, whitespace-trimmed)
- **Pending state UI** on the connected accounts page: pending rows render in info-styled treatment with the email being confirmed, a help line ("Check your email…"), and dedicated **Resend confirmation** + **Cancel link** buttons. Verified rows keep the **Unlink** button (renamed from "Disconnect" for verb-pair consistency with "linked")
- **Post-OAuth confirming banner** appears once after the OAuth callback redirects back to connected accounts, calling out the email being confirmed and which provider is being linked
- **Provider display names** now render as "GitHub" (not the `titleize`-mangled "Github"), backed by an `Authentication.display_name_for` lookup used by every flash message, mailer subject, and view that names a provider
- **Token-based verify URL** at `GET /account/connected_accounts/verify/:token` works for both signed-in and signed-out users — clicking from an email client redirects appropriately afterwards
- **Resend confirmation** action on each pending row regenerates the token and emails it again. Rate-limited per user

### Security

- **Closes the OAuth-linking email-ownership gap.** Previously, `OmniauthCallbacksController#create` set `verified_at: Time.current` on every signed-in linking attempt, regardless of whether the OAuth-returned email belonged to the user. The new flow refuses to activate the sign-in method until the user proves mailbox ownership of the OAuth email. Pending authentications cannot sign in
- **Cross-user collision blocked.** A signed-in user re-OAuthing with credentials matching another user's existing authentication never transfers ownership; flash leaks no information about whether the token belongs to a different account
- **Cross-user verification spam prevented.** A signed-in attacker can no longer trigger fresh verification emails to a victim by re-OAuthing on the victim's pending UID — the cross-user check fires before the pending-resend branch
- **Per-user rate limit scoping** on `resend_verification`, `account/avatars#update`, and `workspaces/invitations#resend` (`by: -> { Current.user&.id || request.remote_ip }`). Prevents shared-NAT lockout where one user could exhaust another's rate bucket
- **Cross-user verify guard** on `Account::ConnectedAccountsController#verify` — a signed-in user clicking another user's verification link gets the same `invalid_or_expired` flash as a stale token, with no programmatic confirmation that the token belonged to a different account
- **Last-verified-method protection** now counts only verified authentications. Pending auths can always be cancelled (they grant no sign-in capability); a verified auth can only be removed if at least one other verified auth remains
- **Transactional destroy with row lock** (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on Postgres/MySQL; `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` on SQLite) serializes concurrent DELETE requests, preventing the race where two simultaneous unlinks could both pass the count gate
- **Atomic pending-row creation** — the verification token is set in the same SQL write as the auth row's initial `save!`, eliminating the transient state (`verified_at: nil` AND `verification_token: nil`) where a crash mid-flow could leave a row that bypassed verification on a subsequent OAuth attempt
- **Production fix:** `omniauth-google-oauth2` returns `provider: "google_oauth2"` from real callbacks, but the `Authentication` enum stores `"google"`. The new `PROVIDER_MAP` normalizes the strategy name to the enum value at the controller boundary. Without this normalization, every real Google OAuth callback would have raised `ArgumentError: 'google_oauth2' is not a valid provider`. The bug existed pre-feature; this branch fixes it and adds a regression spec that exercises the strategy default

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 Level AAA target)

- **`role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"`** on the post-OAuth confirming banner so screen readers announce the verification-pending state
- **`<ul role="list">` + `<li>`** semantic markup for the authentication rows (was `<div>`/`<div>`)
- **`aria-label`** on each `<li>` describing pending-vs-verified state (e.g., "Google sign-in method, pending verification") so the row's status is programmatically determinable
- **Mailer body contrast fixed:** `.what` text bumped from `#6b7280` (4.8:1) to `#374151` (~10.6:1, AAA); `.footer` text bumped from `#9ca3af` (2.8:1, fails AA) to `#4b5563` (~7.6:1, AAA)
- All Resend / Cancel link / Unlink buttons retain `min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px]` touch targets and `focus:ring-2` focus indicators
- HTML mailer template links to a single descriptive CTA ("Yes, this was me — finish linking"), not "click here"
- Plain-text alternative provided for the verification email

### Infrastructure

- **1116 examples, 0 failures**; line coverage ~94%, branch coverage ~82%
- **35 commits** across two merged branches (`feat/verified-oauth-linking` and `chore/oauth-linking-followups`), each commit independently bisect-safe
- New schema column: `authentications.email` (nullable string, captures OAuth-returned email per row)
- New routes: `POST /account/connected_accounts/:id/resend_verification`, `GET /account/connected_accounts/verify/:token`
- New mailer: `AuthenticationMailer#link_verification_email` + HTML/text templates
- New model methods: `Authentication#display_provider`, `Authentication.display_name_for`, `Authentication#assign_verification_token` (non-persisting helper used by both the controller's atomic-create path and the model's `generate_verification_token!`), `Authentication#pending?`, `Authentication#token_expired?`, scope `Authentication.pending`. The legacy `Authentication#verification_token_expired?` now delegates to `token_expired?` so `TOKEN_LIFETIME` is the single source of truth for the 24h window
- New controller actions: `Account::ConnectedAccountsController#verify`, `#resend_verification`. `#destroy` rewritten to count only verified auths, with transactional row-lock semantics. `OmniauthCallbacksController#create` decomposed into `handle_existing_auth` / `handle_signed_in_link` / `handle_new_user_oauth` private branches with a `PROVIDER_MAP` normalization helper
- New locale files / blocks: `config/locales/en/oauth.en.yml` (new file with `omniauth_callbacks.create.*` keys), expanded `account.en.yml` blocks for `connected_accounts.index/destroy/verify/resend_verification`, `authentication_mailer.link_verification_email.*` keys
- Design doc and implementation plan preserved in [modelrails_base_docs](https://github.com/dschmura/modelrails_base_docs) at `superpowers/specs/2026-04-25-verified-oauth-account-linking-design.md` and `superpowers/plans/2026-04-25-verified-oauth-account-linking.md`

### Acknowledged limitations (deferred)

- **`info.email_verified: false` from Google is not gated.** If a Google IdP reports the OAuth email as unverified at the provider level, the new-user OAuth signup path still trusts it. Closing this requires a product decision (refuse OAuth signup, or require an additional verification step) and is tracked separately
- **Email comparison is byte-exact ASCII.** International/IDN addresses (e.g. `Юлия@example.ru`), Turkish dotless-i, and `+`-aliased addresses are treated as different from their canonical form, routing through verification even when visually identical to the user's primary. Acceptable for an English-first starter kit; tracked for later if/when IDN parity matters
- **Resend collision under simultaneous double-click** raises `RecordNotUnique` (DB unique index on `verification_token` saves correctness) but isn't gracefully rescued in the controller. Effectively rate-limited to 3-per-3min, so unlikely to manifest in practice

## v1.2.0 — Footer Cohesion + Developer Ergonomics

### Footer (user-facing)

- Two-row layout: brand + clustered navigation on row 1, centered copyright on row 2
- Nav links grouped into **Product** (About, Docs) and **Legal & privacy** (Privacy, Contact, Cookie settings) clusters separated by a vertical divider
- "Cookie settings" replaces the Biscuit gem's floating bottom-left button; the Biscuit preferences panel now reopens from an in-footer link via a 10-line `footer_controller.js` Stimulus controller that dispatches to the gem's hidden action button
- Responsive: mobile stacks vertically, tablet wraps and centers, desktop anchors left with the dev trigger pushed right
- WCAG 2.2 Level AAA target size: all footer links and the Cookie settings button use `min-h-[44px]`

### Developer tools (development-only, never rendered in production)

- **Clickable letter_opener link on "Check your email"** — the H2 on `sessions/check_email.html.erb` becomes a link to `/letter_opener` in development, opening the sent email in a new tab without leaving the auth flow
- **Accessibility-simulation drop-up in the footer** — toggle between Normal, Blur, Grayscale, Deuteranopia, Low contrast, and Cataract filters to pressure-test pages against vision-impairment conditions. Keyboard: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+A opens, 0–5 jump to modes, Esc / Tab closes. State persists across reloads via localStorage; live region announces mode changes for screen readers
- **`aria-live` status region** on the a11y sim for WCAG 4.1.3 compliance
- **`aria-hidden` SVG filter defs** inlined in the partial; body-level CSS filter classes applied to `<body>` so modals and toasts receive the filter

### Fixes

- Disable CSP on `LetterOpenerWeb::ApplicationController` in development. The production CSP's `frame_src: :none` and nonce-enforced `script_src` blocked the gem's email-preview iframe and inline scripts. The engine is dev-only (mounted conditionally in `config/routes.rb`), so the override is scoped safely via `Rails.application.config.to_prepare`

### Infrastructure

- 1025 examples, 0 failures; coverage 94.46% line / 82.05% branch
- New view spec (`spec/views/shared/footer_spec.rb`) and system spec (`spec/system/footer_cookies_spec.rb`) covering footer structure, link clusters, and Cookie settings reopen flow
- Design doc and implementation plan preserved in [modelrails_base_docs](https://github.com/dschmura/modelrails_base_docs) at `superpowers/specs/2026-04-22-footer-cohesion-design.md` and `superpowers/plans/2026-04-22-footer-cohesion.md`

## v1.1.0 — Auth Redesign: Smart Sign-In + Magic Links

### Smart Sign-In Flow
- Unified email-first sign-in: single email field intelligently routes users
- Existing user with password → password form (within Turbo Frame)
- Existing passwordless user → magic link sent, inline "check your email" confirmation
- Unknown email → registration magic link sent, same inline confirmation
- "Send me a sign-in link instead" option on password form for password users

### Magic Links
- MagicLinkToken model with secure token generation, 15-minute expiry, one-time consumption
- Magic link sign-in for existing users (clears token after use)
- Passwordless registration via magic link (name-only form, no password required)
- Registration auto-creates verified email authentication record
- MagicLinkMailer with sign-in and registration email templates

### UI
- Turbo Frame inline transitions: check-email confirmation replaces sign-in form in-place
- Screen reader announcements via `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`
- `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative icons

### Security
- Rate limiting on magic link requests (5 per 3 minutes)
- Rate limiting on session lookup (10 per 3 minutes)
- No information leakage: same response for existing and non-existent emails

## v1.0.0 — Phase 5B: Admin + Security + Polish

### Admin
- Rake tasks: `users:unlock[email]`, `users:verify[email]`, `users:suspend[email]`
- Suspend destroys all sessions and deactivates all memberships

### Real-Time
- Turbo Stream broadcasts on workspace and project streams
- Morph-based refresh (`broadcast_refresh_to`) — no partial rendering in models
- Workspace stream: membership, invitation, project, and settings changes
- Project stream: resource and project membership changes
- Resilient: broadcast failures never break primary operations

### Security
- Security headers initializer (X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, CSP)
- Rate limiting on registration and password reset endpoints (Rails 8 `rate_limit` DSL)
- All auth endpoints now rate-limited (login was already covered)

### Documentation
- Markdowndocs gem integration at `/docs`
- Starter docs: Getting Started, Architecture, Extending, Security
- Security docs include Top Secret and Rack::Attack production recommendations

### Infrastructure
- 439+ examples, 0 failures
- Brakeman clean (1 known mass assignment note)
- 95%+ line coverage

## v0.5.0-alpha — Phase 5A: Resource Layer + Activity Tracking

### Resources
- Polymorphic Resource registry with title, status (draft/published), position, and type allowlist
- Document content type with Action Text (Trix) rich text editor
- One controller serves all resource types — type-specific form/display partials
- ResourcePolicy enforces project membership access (viewer reads, editor creates, creator manages)
- Drag-and-drop reposition via Turbo Stream

### Activity Tracking
- ActivityLog model with polymorphic trackable, workspace scoping, and visibility enum (workspace/admin)
- Trackable concern with `after_commit` callbacks — opt-in per model
- Automatic creation/update tracking on Workspace, Membership, Invitation, Project, and Resource
- Sensitive attribute filtering (tokens, passwords stripped from metadata)
- Failure resilience — tracking errors never break primary operations
- Activity feed on workspace and project show pages

### Infrastructure
- Action Text installed for rich text content
- 404 examples, 0 failures, 95.8% line coverage
- 1 Brakeman note (same known mass assignment on project membership)

---

## v0.4.0 — Phase 4: Projects + Collaboration Spaces

### Projects
- Lightweight, Basecamp-style collaboration spaces within workspaces
- Project CRUD with slug routing, description, and max_projects enforcement
- Enum roles on ProjectMembership (creator/editor/viewer)
- Creator auto-assigned on project creation
- Direct member add for workspace members with role selection
- Pin/unpin projects for quick access (IDOR-safe: finds by current user)
- Logo upload with initials fallback, OKLCH primary color picker
- Soft delete (Discardable) for project archiving

### Personal Workspace
- Auto-created on user sign-up (invisible in consumer UIs)
- Backfill rake task for existing users: `rails users:backfill_personal_workspaces`

### Project Invitations
- Polymorphic invitation reuse (invitable_type: "Project")
- Auto-adds invitee to workspace (as viewer) + project in one step
- project_role field on invitations (editor/viewer only — "creator" injection blocked by validation)
- Branching accept! flow for workspace vs project invitations
- Handles archived project rejection, discarded member reactivation

### Renames
- `max_teams` → `max_projects` (column + all references)
- `manage_teams` → `manage_projects` (permission JSON data migration)

### Infrastructure
- Workspace membership cascade: deactivating a workspace member destroys their project memberships (in transaction)
- Pundit policies for Project and ProjectMembership
- 280 examples, 0 failures, 94.2% line coverage
- 1 Brakeman note: `user_id` in project membership strong params — intentional, guarded by Pundit creator-only policy

---

## v0.3.0 — Phase 3: Invitations + Membership Lifecycle

### Invitations
- Email invitations with role assignment and 7-day expiry
- Batch invitations (multi-line email input, single role)
- Magic link invitations (shareable token URL, no email required)
- Resend (regenerates token, resets expiry) and revoke actions
- Polymorphic invitable (ready for Team invitations in Phase 4)
- InvitationMailer with accept/decline links

### Accept/Decline Flow
- Token-based accept page (works for authenticated and unauthenticated users)
- Unauthenticated users redirected to registration, auto-joined after sign-up
- Token-based decline with confirmation page
- Guards against expired, revoked, and already-used invitations

### Membership Lifecycle
- Role change by Owner/Admin
- Member deactivation (soft delete) with last-owner protection
- Member reactivation
- Ownership transfer (atomic: promote target, demote self)

### Authorization (Pundit)
- Pundit policies for Invitation, Membership, Workspace, Settings, Branding
- Permission checks via Role.permissions JSON (manage_workspace, manage_members, manage_teams, manage_settings)
- Retrofitted Phase 2 controllers (replaced inline role checks)
- Graceful rescue_from for unauthorized access

### Infrastructure
- 217 examples, 0 failures, 92.3% line coverage
- 0 Brakeman warnings

## v0.2.0 — Phase 2: Workspaces + Multi-tenancy + Ownership + Branding

### Workspaces
- Create, edit, and archive workspaces with auto-generated slugs
- Path-based routing (`/workspaces/:slug/...`)
- Plan enum (free, pro, enterprise) with no tier enforcement (forker's job)
- Configurable max members and max teams per workspace

### Multi-tenancy
- `Current.workspace` for request-scoped workspace context
- `Tenanted` concern with explicit `for_current_workspace` scope (no default_scope)
- `WorkspaceScoped` controller concern for nested controllers
- Session-tracked current workspace for navigation state

### Roles and Membership
- 4 seeded system roles: Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer
- Permissions JSON on roles (data model ready for Phase 3 Pundit policies)
- Workspace-scoped custom roles at data model level
- Creator auto-assigned as Owner on workspace creation
- Read-only members list
- Owner/Admin role check on settings and branding

### Branding
- Workspace logo upload (Active Storage) with initials fallback
- OKLCH primary color picker with live CSS variable preview (Stimulus)

### UI
- Workspace switcher dropdown in navigation (keyboard-navigable)
- App theme updated from cyan to sky throughout
- `Discardable` concern for consistent soft delete pattern

### Infrastructure
- Bullet gem for N+1 detection (raises in test, alerts in development)
- Brakeman verified clean (0 warnings)
- 133 examples, 0 failures, 89.7% line coverage
