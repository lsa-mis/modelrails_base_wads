# ModelRails

A multi-tenant SaaS starter kit built on Rails 8.1.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Rails 8.1, Ruby 4.0.6
- **Database:** SQLite (Solid Queue/Cache/Cable in-process)
- **Frontend:** TailwindCSS 4, Turbo, Stimulus
- **Assets:** Propshaft, Importmaps
- **Auth:** Rails 8 authentication generator, magic links, OmniAuth (Google, GitHub), Pundit
- **Real-Time:** Turbo Stream broadcasts (morph-based refresh)
- **Content:** Action Text with [Lexxy](https://github.com/basecamp/lexxy) (Lexical-based rich text editor)
- **Docs:** Markdowndocs engine at `/docs` (deployment, background jobs, getting started, architecture, security, …)
- **Testing:** RSpec, FactoryBot, Capybara, Cuprite (pure-Ruby CDP), axe-core (WCAG 2.2 AAA), Bullet (N+1 detection)
- **Security:** Rate limiting, security headers, CSP, Pwned password check
- **Deployment:** Kamal → GitHub Container Registry; CI verifies the production image builds on every PR
- **Version Management:** [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (see `.tool-versions`; `Gemfile` reads from it so Bundler enforces the Ruby version everywhere)
- **Dev Container:** Optional VS Code Dev Container ships with `ruby:4.0.6-slim` base (matches production), `docker-outside-of-docker` for in-container `kamal deploy`, named bundle cache volume

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (or asdf) for runtime version management
- Chromium (managed automatically by Cuprite/Ferrum for system tests)

### Getting started

```bash
# Install the Ruby version from .tool-versions
mise install

# Install dependencies, prepare database, start server
bin/setup
```

Or step by step:

```bash
bundle install
bin/rails db:prepare
bin/dev
```

### Running tests

```bash
bin/parallel-rspec   # full suite across all cores + integrity gates (what CI runs)
bundle exec rspec    # single-process run (focused files, debugging)
```

With documentation output:

```bash
bundle exec rspec --format documentation
```

Coverage report is generated at `coverage/index.html`.

### OAuth configuration

Google and GitHub OAuth require credentials. Add them via per-environment Rails
credentials (the template ships none; the first run generates the file and key):

```bash
bin/rails credentials:edit --environment development
```

Add the following structure:

```yaml
google:
  client_id: your_google_client_id
  client_secret: your_google_client_secret

github:
  client_id: your_github_client_id
  client_secret: your_github_client_secret
```

OAuth is optional — email/password sign-up works without it.

## Forking this template

This repo is an upstream template: clone it with full history, build your product
in fork-owned files, and merge upstream improvements back in periodically.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dschmura/modelrails_base.git myapp
cd myapp
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLED
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOU/myapp.git   # an empty repo — no README/license
git push -u origin main
git config merge.ours.driver true                    # activates the fork-owned merge driver
```

The complete guide — identity-rename checklist, secrets bootstrap, the fork-owned
file contract, and the upstream-update workflow — lives in
[app/docs/developer/forking.md](app/docs/developer/forking.md), rendered at `/docs/developer/forking` in the
running app. Your fork inherits it.

## What's included (Phase 1)

### Authentication
- Smart sign-in: single email field routes users to the right auth method
  - Existing user with password → password form (with "send magic link instead" option)
  - Existing passwordless user → magic link sent automatically
  - Unknown email → registration magic link sent
- Magic link sign-in with 15-minute token expiry and one-time use
- Passwordless registration via magic link (name-only form, no password required)
- Email/password sign-up with 12-character minimum and Pwned password breach detection
- Account locking after 5 failed attempts (1-hour auto-unlock)
- Password reset using Rails 8.1 signed tokens (15-minute expiry)
- Email verification with 24-hour token expiry
- Turbo Frame inline transitions (check-email confirmation replaces form in-place)

### OAuth
- Google and GitHub sign-in via OmniAuth
- Automatic account linking by email for new OAuth signups (matches verified existing users)
- Signed-in users can link additional providers; if the OAuth-returned email matches the user's primary email, the link auto-verifies, otherwise a verification email is sent to the OAuth address and the link stays pending until clicked
- Pending OAuth authentications cannot sign in. Users can resend the confirmation email (rate-limited per user) or cancel the pending link from connected accounts
- 24-hour token expiry on verification links; cross-user collision blocked; per-user rate limit on resend
- OAuth-only users can add email/password sign-in

### Account management
- Profile editing (name, email)
- Avatar upload (Active Storage) with Gravatar fallback
- Connected accounts view with last-verified-method protection (can't remove the only verified sign-in method; pending auths can always be cancelled)
- Theme preferences (light, dark, system) with Stimulus controller and Turbo Stream updates

### UI
- All text via I18n locale files (no hardcoded strings)
- WCAG 2.2 AAA contrast ratios
- Skip-to-content link, semantic HTML landmarks
- 44px minimum touch targets on interactive elements
- Dark mode support throughout
- Accessible forms with labels, ARIA attributes, and focus rings
- Design system primitives — see [design-system.md](https://github.com/dschmura/modelrails_base_docs/blob/main/design-system.md) for spacing tokens, component utilities, and naming conventions.
