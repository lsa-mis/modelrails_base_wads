# Fires when a Membership is created — i.e. a user joins (or is added to) a workspace.
#
# Dual-recipient design (v1 catalog):
#   1. The added user — receives in-app + email (email gated by their workspace_activity.email pref).
#   2. All workspace owners EXCLUDING the added user — receive in-app only.
#      Email is suppressed per-recipient by an event-level conditional; the digest
#      pipeline (separate, scheduled job) is the intended fallback delivery for owners.
#
# In-app gating happens at recipient-resolution time: users whose workspace_activity.in_app
# preference is false are filtered out of `recipients` entirely, so no notification row is
# created for them. The :database delivery method is deprecated in Noticed 2.9.x — rows are
# auto-saved by the deliver pipeline — so per-recipient in-app gating MUST happen here.
#
# Users without a UserPreferences row (default factory output) are treated as "opted in" for
# in-app at the column default level via `ApplicationNotifier.preferences_for`, which wraps
# the schema default JSONB blob. Without this fallback, freshly-created users would be silently
# filtered out of every workspace_activity dispatch.
#
# Email gating mirrors the WorkspaceRoleChangedNotifier pattern: a `before_enqueue` lambda
# throws :abort to skip the email job when (a) the recipient is anyone other than the added
# user, or (b) the added user opted out of workspace_activity.email.
