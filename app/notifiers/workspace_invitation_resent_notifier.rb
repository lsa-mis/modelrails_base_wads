# Confirms to the inviter (NOT the invitee) that they re-sent an invitation.
# The invitee email is delivered separately by InvitationMailer.invite from
# the resend controller action; this notifier is purely the in-app
# confirmation surface for the actor.
#
# The 1-minute idempotency bucket inherited from ApplicationNotifier is the
# UX guardrail against double-click resends — second click within the same
# minute returns :deduplicated, which the controller branches on to render
# a "recently sent" flash instead of a duplicate "sent" flash.
