  # Day-bucket idempotency override.
  #
  # The base ApplicationNotifier seeds (class, record.id, minute). This Notifier
  # is dispatched by `WorkspaceInvitationExpiringSweepJob`, which scans the
  # 24-hour expiring window every 6 hours. With a minute-bucket key, each
  # invitation in the window would receive ~4 dispatches per day (one per
  # sweep tick). A per-(invitation, day) key collapses those to one
  # notification per invitation per day until the invitation is accepted,
  # declined, or expired and falls out of the sweep window.
  #
  # Cross-day dispatches still succeed: an invitation that lingers in the
  # sweep window on day N and day N+1 will produce one notification each day,
  # which is the intended cadence (escalating reminder volume is digest
  # territory, not idempotency).
