# frozen_string_literal: true

# Fires when a scheduled sweep job (`WorkspaceCapacitySweepJob`) detects that a
# workspace has reached >= 80% of its `max_members` quota. Recipients are every
# owner of the workspace; channels are in-app + email; category is `:billing`
# (NOT security — DND suppresses these).
#
# Idempotency:
#   The base ApplicationNotifier seeds (class, record.id, minute). For a billing
#   alert that's emitted by a recurring sweep, a one-minute bucket is too tight:
#   the sweep cadence is 12 hours, but two manual triggers in the same minute
#   would silently collapse, AND we want at most one alert per (workspace, metric)
#   per DAY regardless of how many sweep runs land in that day. Override with
#   a day-bucket key folded with the metric so:
#     - Members and projects metrics for the same workspace on the same day each
#       get one alert (don't collapse onto each other).
#     - Repeat sweeps the same day collapse onto the same key (deduplicated).
#     - The next day's sweep gets a fresh key (delivers again if still over).
#
# In-app gating happens at recipient-resolution time: owners whose
# billing.in_app preference is false (or DND on, since billing is non-security)
# are filtered out of `recipients` entirely, so no notification row is created
# for them. This mirrors WorkspaceMemberAddedNotifier's gate point — the
# :database delivery method is deprecated in Noticed 2.9.x, so per-recipient
# in-app gating MUST happen here.
