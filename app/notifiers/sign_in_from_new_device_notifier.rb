# Fires the first time a user signs in from a (user_agent, os) digest we
# haven't recorded for them. Mirrors PasswordChangedNotifier's shape:
# `category :security` so it auto-registers as a security type and bypasses
# DND, with both in-app and email channels gated by per-recipient
# preferences. Email uses the `before_enqueue throw(:abort)` idiom so an
# opt-out skips the job entirely rather than enqueueing-then-discarding.

  # The base ApplicationNotifier seeds (class, record.id, minute). Here
  # `record` is the user — meaning a phisher signing in seconds after the
  # legitimate user would silently lose their alert to the dedup index, or a
  # user switching from laptop to phone would only see the first alert. By
  # folding the same browser digest used by `User.browser_digest` into the
  # key, dedup is now (user, device, minute) — collapse only on a true
  # same-device retry, which IS the legitimate dedup case.
  #
  # 12 hex chars (~48 bits) is plenty: the goal is differentiation between
  # devices for one user inside a one-minute window, not cryptographic
  # uniqueness. Truncation keeps the column readable in logs.
