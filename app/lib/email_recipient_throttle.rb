# Per-recipient email throttle. Caps how many emails of a given KIND we'll send
# to a single email address within a sliding window — orthogonal to the per-user
# rate limits that already gate the controller actions that send mail.
#
# Why this exists: a per-user rate limit (`rate_limit by: -> { Current.user&.id }`)
# stops one attacker from spamming verification emails. It does not stop
# "Alice (attacker A) tries once, then Bob (attacker B) tries once, then Carol
# (attacker C) tries once..." — coordinated attack or attacker-with-N-accounts.
# The recipient (victim@example.com) sees N emails to their inbox even though
# every individual sender stayed under their per-user limit.
#
# This module gates by the *recipient* address. Counter lives in Rails.cache
# (Solid Cache in this project), keyed by SHA-256 of the canonical email +
# the kind (verification / collision_alert / etc). Independent buckets per
# kind so a flood of one type doesn't suppress legitimate sends of another.
#
# Default policy: 3 sends per recipient per kind per hour. Tightening or
# loosening should happen here, not at callsites.

  WINDOW = 1.hour
  CAP = 3

  # Atomically increments the recipient's counter for the given kind, then
  # returns true if the send is allowed (count <= CAP after increment) or
  # false if the cap was exceeded.
  #
  # Fail-open semantics: if Rails.cache.increment returns nil (cache backend
  # unavailable, or driver doesn't support increment), this returns true.
  # Email delivery is more important than the throttle in a degraded state.
