# frozen_string_literal: true

# Refreshes a user's four independent notification surfaces:
#   - avatar button frame  (refreshes aria-label so AT narrative stays
#                           coherent with the severity-colored chip overlay)
#   - bell indicator frame (severity-colored chip overlay on the avatar)
#   - menu count frame     (Notifications menu-link count text, e.g. "(3)")
#   - aria-live region     (SR announcement)
#
# Each broadcast runs in its own rescue scope: a failure on ONE surface
# must NOT abort the other three. Real failure mode this prevents: a
# transient cable adapter hiccup or a partial-rendering exception on the
# first broadcast used to silently drop the bell + count + aria-live
# refresh, leaving the UI stale.
#
# `announcement_key` is an I18n key passed straight to `I18n.t`. Two
# canonical values exist today:
#   - notifications.bell.arrival_announcement   ("New notification")
#   - notifications.bell.read_state_announcement ("Notifications updated")
#
# Two callers, one shape:
#   1. ApplicationNotifier#broadcast_notifications_arrival (after_create_commit
#      on the event), called per recipient.
#   2. Account::NotificationsController#broadcast_bell_refresh, called for
#      Current.user after a read-state mutation (mark/unmark, mark_all_read,
#      open, destroy-when-unread).
#
# The swallow-log-report contract from PR #97 lives here too (per
# broadcast): a cable adapter outage doesn't propagate back to notification
# creation or controller actions but still reaches error tracking.
#
# Performance: the unread breakdown summary is computed ONCE at the top of
# refresh_for and passed to each receiving partial as a `summary:` local.
# This avoids 3 redundant `unread_notification_breakdown` queries that
# would otherwise fire (one per partial that needs it).
