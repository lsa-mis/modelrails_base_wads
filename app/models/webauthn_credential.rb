  # count, so concurrent assertions can't both "advance" past the same value.
  # Per WebAuthn §7.2 the signature counter is only meaningful when nonzero —
  # platform passkeys (Apple/Google) always report 0, which means "no counter
  # support", not a clone. So accept when new_count is 0 OR strictly greater than
  # the stored count; flag a clone only on a nonzero, non-advancing count. MAX()
  # keeps the stored value monotonic so a stray 0 never lowers a real counter.
