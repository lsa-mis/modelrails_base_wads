  # Two-path implementation to avoid an N+1 on `workspaces#index` without
  # introducing staleness on mutating call sites:
  #
  # * When `memberships` is already loaded (controller preloads
  #   `memberships: [:role, { user: ... }]` for the index page), filter the
  #   in-memory Array — zero extra queries per row. This is the hot path:
  #   `MembershipPolicy#destroy?` calls `.owners.size` on every Leave-button
  #   render.
  # * When `memberships` is NOT loaded (notifier recipient resolution after
  #   a membership mutation), issue a fresh narrow query so we see the
  #   latest committed state. The notifiers run after mutations that change
  #   the owner roster; we cannot reuse a cached Array there without risk
  #   of stale reads.
