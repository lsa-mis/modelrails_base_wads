# app/views/layouts/settings.html.erb's shared <main> carries no vertical
# padding of its own (by design — see the 2026-07-02 header-spacing design
# review). Every settings page must supply exactly one top-padding source:
# either the shared .page-container/.page-container-wide class (which both
# carry padding-block: var(--space-section-gap)), or its own explicit
# py-*/pt-* utility for pages whose width doesn't match either named class.
#
# The historical bug this guards against: the layout USED to hardcode its
# own py-8, and pages ALSO added their own py-16/py-8 on top, silently
# compounding to 64-96px effective (all 8 settings pages, caught by eye
# during design review, not CI). This spec keeps both failure directions —
# zero sources (page floats flush under the header) and two sources
# (compounding) — caught by CI going forward.
