# Preview-host accessibility proof for the customizable-select picker styling
# (`@supports (appearance: base-select)`). In supporting browsers (our Playwright
# Chromium ≥ 130) `.ui-select` renders a fully styled picker in the top layer; we
# OPEN it via a real click and audit the LIVE options, since a closed picker's
# options are not rendered (axe would skip them).
#
# NOTE: the per-spec axe call runs axe's default (AA) rule set; the authoritative
# AAA 7:1 audit is the CI-only wcag2aaa after-hook (spec/support/playwright_accessibility.rb).
