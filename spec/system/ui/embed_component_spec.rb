# Preview-host WCAG 2.2 AAA proof for the embed component.
#
# Every embed renders a non-blank iframe `title` (the accessible name of the
# embedded region). We prove the titled iframe is present per provider and that
# the wrapper clears AAA in both themes. The per-spec axe call runs the default
# (AA) rule set; the authoritative AAA 7:1 audit is the CI-only wcag2aaa
# after-hook (spec/support/playwright_accessibility.rb).
