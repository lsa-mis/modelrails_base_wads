# Preview-host WCAG 2.2 AAA proof for the list_group component.
#
# list_group renders a bare <ul> (no landmark role), so each preview wraps the
# list in #lg-scope and the audit is scoped there — keeping the host chrome's
# best-practice advisories (landmark-one-main, page-has-heading-one) out of
# scope WITHOUT excluding any rule. No color-contrast exclude: a real contrast
# failure on a row (including the filled active link, text-on-interactive on
# bg-interactive) would still fail this spec.
#
# The structural assertions hold the hardened contract: list children are always
# <li> (never bare anchors); link rows nest the <a> inside the <li>, carry the
# focus-ring outline, and the active link is aria-current="page".
