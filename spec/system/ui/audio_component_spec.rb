# Preview-host WCAG 2.2 AAA proof for the audio component.
#
# The native <audio> element renders the browser's own (keyboard-operable,
# UA-labelled) controls, so the 0b only proves the element is present and the
# surrounding chrome clears AAA in both themes. The per-spec axe call runs the
# default (AA) rule set; the authoritative AAA 7:1 audit is the CI-only
# wcag2aaa after-hook (spec/support/playwright_accessibility.rb).

  # and collides across scoped 0b specs).
