# Preview-host WCAG 2.2 AAA proof for the alert component.
#
# The destructive variant renders danger-colored text on `bg-surface-raised`.
# In DARK mode, surface-raised is the LIGHTEST dark surface (neutral-800), where
# danger-text contrast is lowest. This spec audits each scenario UNSCOPED on the
# alert (no color-contrast exclude) so it genuinely proves the dark
# `--color-danger` token now clears AAA 7:1 on the lightest dark surface — not
# that we excluded the failing element.
#
# The preview-host minimal layout emits axe best-practice advisories
# (landmark-one-main, page-has-heading-one) that are NOT WCAG and NOT about the
# alert. We scope the audit to the alert subtree by its live-region role so we
# audit the COMPONENT, not the host chrome. No color-contrast exclude is added:
# if a real contrast violation remained on the alert, this spec would fail and
# the token would not be fixed yet.
