# Preview-host WCAG 2.2 AAA proof for the badge component.
#
# The badge is the per-surface-AAA risk component: most variants carry their own
# text/fill pair, but `ghost` and `outline` derive their contrast from the
# SURROUNDING surface (no self fill). The preview host body is
# `bg-surface-raised text-text-body` (see app/views/layouts/component_preview.html.erb),
# which in DARK mode is the LIGHTEST dark surface (neutral-800) — the worst case for
# text-on-surface contrast. This spec audits every meaningful variant UNSCOPED on the
# badge subtree (no color-contrast exclude) so a real contrast failure on any variant —
# including the adaptive `destructive` (white -> text-on-interactive) and the
# context-dependent `ghost`/`outline` — would FAIL here, not be hidden.
#
# The four signal levels (`info`/`success`/`warning`/`danger`) are audited here because
# they MUST be: each renders text on a soft `*-surface` tint, and a contrast failure on
# any of them is invisible to render-tests. A warning badge that read `text-text-heading`
# on `bg-warning` shipped past CI precisely because warning-with-text was not in this
# audited set — it is now. `destructive` (alias of `danger`) and the context-dependent
# `ghost`/`outline` (no self fill — contrast derives from the host surface) round out the
# set; if any genuinely fails AAA on this host surface that is a real token/variant
# finding, not something to exclude.
#
# The preview host's minimal layout emits axe best-practice advisories
# (landmark-one-main, page-has-heading-one) that are NOT WCAG and NOT about the badge.
# We scope the audit to the badge subtree by element type so those host-chrome
# advisories stay out of scope WITHOUT excluding any rule.
