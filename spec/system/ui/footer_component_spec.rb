# Preview-host WCAG 2.2 AAA proof for the footer component.
#
# footer renders a `<footer>` contentinfo landmark, so axe scopes by `footer` — the
# minimal preview layout emits no footer of its own, so this scopes cleanly to the
# component. NO color-contrast exclude: proves the AAA tokens on `bg-surface-raised`
# (incl. `text-text-muted`, which is the same neutral as body here) in both themes.
RSpec.describe "Footer component accessibility", type: :system do
  # `let`, not a top-level constant (a constant inside describe leaks to ::SCOPE and
  # collides across scoped 0b specs → axe scopes to the wrong selector).
