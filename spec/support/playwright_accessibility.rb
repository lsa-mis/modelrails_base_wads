  # Selectors excluded from axe checks by default. These mark UI surfaces with
  # known AAA-contrast debt that is tracked separately and not allowed to gate
  # unrelated work:
  #
  # - .biscuit-banner   GDPR consent banner (biscuit-rails gem). The primary
  #                     button's OKLCH-derived background + text combination
  #                     currently sits at ~4.8:1, below AAA's 7:1. Tightening
  #                     it without dropping `--biscuit-accent` saturation
  #                     across every workspace hue is a follow-up.
  # - .highlight        Rouge syntax-highlighting palette
  #                     (--syntax-builtin/-comment/-name/-string/-tag) sits at
  #                     AA. Bumping every token to AAA changes how every code
  #                     example looks sitewide and is deferred. Was previously
  #                     gated via `pending` markers in spec/system/docs_spec.rb.
  # - .text-danger      Danger signal text on default surfaces under specific
  #                     hue cascades sits below AAA in dark mode. Tracked
  #                     separately from workspace-branded interactive debt.
  #
  # `.text-interactive` and `.bg-interactive` were previously deferred under
  # the workspace-branded color-mix umbrella; the durable two-variable scheme
  # (`--ws-primary-light` + `--ws-primary-dark`, see
  # `app/assets/tailwind/application.css` "Workspace Branding Override")
  # made them AAA-compliant deterministically, so they are no longer excluded.
  #
  # A spec that specifically needs to audit these elements should pass an
  # explicit `exclude:` value (e.g., `exclude: [".biscuit-banner"]` to keep
  # biscuit out of scope while still checking `.highlight`). Pass `[]` for the
  # raw, unfiltered audit.
