# Regression coverage for the shared header rendering inside a Rails engine
# (markdowndocs). The header renders `avatar_for`, which calls
# `image_tag variant` — and `image_tag` resolves the variant into a URL
# through the *current* rendering context's URL helpers. From inside the
# markdowndocs engine, the engine's routes don't include Active Storage
# routes, so the resolution fails with:
#
#   Can't resolve image into URL:
#   undefined method 'to_model' for an instance of ActiveStorage::VariantWithRecord
#
# The fix is to anchor the resolution through `main_app.url_for(variant)`
# in both `avatar_helper#render_upload_avatar` and
# `workspace_helper#render_workspace_logo`.
