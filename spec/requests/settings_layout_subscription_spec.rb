# the authenticated user's page to the current workspace's Turbo stream when in
# org context. This is the SUBSCRIBER half of the Membership broadcast contract:
# Membership includes Broadcastable and broadcasts refresh to its workspace on
# create + update (covered by spec/models/broadcasts_spec.rb). Without the
# layout subscription, those broadcasts have no listener — and the Phase 2
# demotion-while-viewing flow (Task 15) cannot re-render the demoted user's
# open settings tab.
