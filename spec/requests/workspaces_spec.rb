      # Regression guard: four real N+1s on this surface survived per-task
      # spec-compliance + cross-task code-quality + manual security/N+1 reviews
      # before bin/dev's Bullet panel caught them at runtime. Bullet running
      # against a multi-row end-to-end render is the only thing that reliably
      # exposes eager-load shape regressions on workspaces#index.
      #
      # Mechanism: Bullet.raise = true (config/environments/test.rb) raises
      # mid-request via the Bullet::Rack middleware as soon as the detector
      # sees an N+1 / unused-eager-loading hit. The Rack middleware also
      # wraps each HTTP request in start_request/end_request, which clears
      # the notification_collector before control returns to the spec — so
      # post-hoc Bullet.warnings inspection is not possible from a request
      # spec. The right pattern here is: render with enough rows to expose
      # the eager-load shape and let Bullet.raise fail the example.
      #
      # The single-row examples above don't reliably trip Bullet because
      # NPlusOne detection is threshold-based. This multi-row fixture is
      # what gives the guard its teeth — any future change that breaks
      # the eager-load chain (controller includes, sidebar preload, the
      # workspace_icon_for owner-fallback) fails HERE at CI time.
